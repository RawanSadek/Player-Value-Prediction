# Player-Value-Prediction
The objective of the projects is to apply different machine learning algorithms to real-world tasks. We will show how to clean data, applying pre-processing, feature scaling, regression, and classification methods. Given the provided datasets, we would like to understand and predict a playerâ€™s value/level based on the provided data.
